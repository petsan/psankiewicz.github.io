# What Exactly Is Mobile First Design?
Mobile First is a technigue for using media queries to design a webpage for the mobile view-port first.This means that we write css style sheets targeted at smaller (tall and narrow) viewports as the default styles, then we use media queries to change the layout of the page, as the viewport is widened.

The reason for this, is to conserve mobile bandwidth.  Theory goes, that the mobile user will download less data that is infact useless, as it is meant for the desktop, resulting in lower download times and less bandwidth (data plan) usage.

This approach is also meant as future-proofing. As more and more users use mobile devices as their primary device, this will guarantee that websites won't break when viewed on mobile devices.
