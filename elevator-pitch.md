Hi, I'm Peter

I'm a software specialist
focusing on the
protection
and conservation
of species.

I have 20 + years of proven
industry experience focusing on software security,
quality,
and
assurance in the greater Seattle Area.

As the
principal quality engineer on Vulcan Inc's
Domain Awareness System Earth Ranger

I contributed to the protection of

Elephants,
Rhinos, Tigers
and other species
from poaching across Africa and Asia.

Earth Ranger
processes
thousands of data points per minute
running sophisticated
AI algorithms and
Displaying the status
and postion data of trackers,
sensors,
and other  enviornmental data on a clear, consise tactical map.

<!-- ER provides constant supervisory domain awareness to nearly 100 Wildlife Reserves and Parks, it is self-sufficient and aides  local ranger forces in hampering poachers and avoiding unnecessary, preventable deaths of Rangers, and the killings of Elephants and other endangered species -->

I personally made many significant contributiions to the project's design, quality and effectiveness, over its first four years.

Now at Code Fellows, I am furthering my software journey by becoming an expert in Full-Stack web development with a specialization in C#.
